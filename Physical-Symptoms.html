					Video game addiction isn’t an official disorder by any medical organisations but to a lot of people it is still considered a serious issue because it can still ruin a lot of people's lives.
					<br><br>
					It can lead to both mental and physical effects on people and at extreme levels it can be dangerous since your health will decline and start suffering from the diseases that come with weight gain and being unhealthy. These are the symptoms:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sleep difficulties or changes in sleep patterns</li>
					<li>Decreased personal hygiene habits</li>
					<li>Bad eating habits</li>
					<li>Headaches</li>
					<li>Dry or red eyes</li>
					<li>Fatigued fingers, neck and or back</li>
					<li>Poor physical health and weight gain</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<br>
					The is a very real possibly that in the future that video game addiction/technology addiction will be considered a disorder just like internet addiction which is very similar the same thing. Just because some play plays video games a lot doesn’t necessary mean that they are addicted to video games. Because they might only suffer from the physical symptoms since the physical effects can come just by having one long gaming session while mental symptoms build it up from constantly doing it overtime or just when someone becomes addicted to video games.
