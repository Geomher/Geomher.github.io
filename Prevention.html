					There are many way to limit the time you spend on your devices, preventing the side effects that are caused through this. Ensuring you do not suffer from the symptoms, limit you social media use. This can be a way to prevent yourself from developing an addiction, and you wouldn’t rely on these applications in order to go about your daily life. Partaking in more outdoor activities will limit the time you spend on technology, like joining a club sport or going for more frequent bike rides. This will show you that you don’t need to be in front of a screen to have a good time. Picking up and reading a book will turn that technology time before bed into something productive. Getting into a new genre of novels will take your mind off your devices is much better for you then technology ever was.

					Kids that spend too long on their devices are the ones that would suffer the most. For parents, it is important to monitor how much time that they spend on technology and prevent these symptoms and addictions from happening. By informing them that they don’t need their devices to have a good time, taking them outside and showing them the things they can do.
