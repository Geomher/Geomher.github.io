				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>This report will discuss the mining of iron ore, and the environmental and economic impacts it has on Australia. Mining iron has had many positive impacts towards Australia’s economy as the land of Australia is rich with materials, minerals and metals, one of the most beneficial being iron. Being able to sell, export and distribute these materials is one of Australia’s greatest economic benefactors. However, mining iron and other metals usually results in AMD – Acid Mine (or Metalliferous) Drainage. This is the release of acidic water from a mining site that damages the environment. After investigating these negative impacts, this report will also discuss what scientists have learnt from past AMD incidents, and what new technologies and methods have and are currently being developed to improve mining efficiency, while also minimising and potentially stopping the negative environmental impacts of mining and AMD.</p>
				
				<h3>Positive Aspects of Mining Iron in Australia</h3>
				
				<p>Iron ore production plays a great part in boosting the Australian economy. It is one of the world’s largest iron exporters, producing over 660 million tonnes of iron ore and over 50 billion dollars a year. It also provides over 60,000 people around Australia with jobs and employment. This includes engineers, geologists, operators, tradesmen, accountants, and many more. The iron itself has the most benefits, as it is the most used metal around the world. It’s a main ingredient of steel, and is used in several different industries including engineering, construction, machinery and automotive. Without iron ore, the world would look very different. </p>
				
				<h3>What is AMD and what Impacts does it have on the Environment</h3>
				
				<p>One unfortunate downside to mining iron is Acid Mine Drainage. This is acidic water formed from a reaction between rocks containing sulphur (usually Iron Sulphide – FeS<sub>2</sub>, also known as pyrite or “fool’s gold”), water and oxygen. One product of these three reactants is sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), a highly corrosive chemical that can be transferred from the mine site by rainwater or surface drainage to the environment. This can pollute any river, stream or lake that is close by, creating several environmental consequences. The water carries high concentrations of metal ions and acidity. This would cause the water to become undrinkable, and damage pipes and machinery, making industrial applications in water useless. It would also kill plant and animal life as the high concentrations of iron and other solids would decrease light, affecting photosynthesis of plants, and the acidity would cause gill damage and corrosion to fish and other sea life.<br><br>
				
				There are 4 chemical reactions that occur for pyrite to weather into AMD. This includes the oxidisation of pyrite into sulphate, the changing of ferrous iron to ferric iron, the hydrolysis of iron into ferric hydroxide precipitate or “yellow boy” – Fe (OH) <sub>3-</sub>. Even though there are four reactions involved, it can all be summarised in one equation. When pyrite reacts with oxygen and water, the products are yellow boy (a yellowy-orange solid that is visible when AMD is present) and sulphuric acid.</p>

				<h3>Prevention of Negative Environmental Impacts in the Future</h3>
				
				<p>AMD is an increasingly large problem that is occurring in mines all over the world. Scientists everywhere are using their knowledge, understanding, and inquiry to develop a solution. In Australia, several organizations and divisions of the government have or are working on a solution, including the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (DIIS), the Department of Environment and Energy, the Office of the Supervising Scientist (OSS), the Australian Centre for Mine site Rehabilitation Research (ACMRR) and the Minerals Council of Australia. Even though these are all different units of the government or organizations, some of them collaborated with each other to research the problem and develop a solution. Several years ago, the OSS and ACMRR wrote a status report on AMD in mining sites in Australia, investigating the extent and severity of the problem, and the potential future liability and risk. This was supported by the government and also the Minerals Council of Australia. <br><br>
				
				The DIIS however probably did the most research and work into this issue. Unlike other mining companies that choose to handle AMD by collecting it or treating it after it happens, the DIIS’s strategy is to prevent and minimise it from happening in the first place. During the early phases of a mine’s development or “life”, scientists will regularly sample and monitor the metals in the mine and conduct geochemical tests/assessments on them to characterise the mine material and predict AMD risk and danger. This allows them to see the probability and consequences of AMD early, so they can prevent it before it becomes a serious problem. The main method to prevent AMD is to stop or minimise the oxidisation of the waste pyrite. This is accomplished by building a cover system over the Waste Rock Dump (WRD) which contains all the waste pyrite so that the chance of it coming into contact with oxygen or water is minimised, therefore preventing AMD from forming. </p>
				
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p>The mining of iron ore has many benefits and advantages, however, can also produce negative consequences. This being Acid Mine Drainage – acidic water discharged from a mining site. Fortunately, different groups of scientists have collaborated and communicated to develop solutions from what they’ve learnt from past AMD incidents. The strategy that the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science uses is to regularly monitor and collect data from tests and samples of the metals in the mine to predict risk, and then construct cover systems over places where waste pyrite is stored (such as the WRD) to prevent oxidisation and the formation of AMD. This report shows the SHE concept Application and Limitation as it explains the consequences of AMD that required monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of risk and provides opportunities for innovation. It also shows how scientific knowledge, understanding and inquiry were used to develop solutions. The report shows the topic Communication and Collaboration as it examines how the collaboration of scientists and governments is needed for scientific studies. Without these two SHE concepts, scientists would never have been able to develop a solution.</p>
