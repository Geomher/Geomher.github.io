				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>An organic compound is a chemical compound that consists of a chain of carbon atoms that are bonded with hydrogen atoms (See figure 1.0). Standard organic compounds fall into three main categories – alkanes which contain only one covalent bond between carbon atoms, alkenes which contain at least one double bond, and alkynes which contain at least one triple bond. Alcohols are a derivative of organic compounds. They also consist of carbon chains bonded to hydrogens, however, include a hydroxyl group (OH) bonded to one of the carbons. All alcohols end in “-ol”. There are 3 main types of alcohols: primary, secondary and tertiary.</p>
				<p class="img-caption">Figure 1.0 (Hydrocarbon)</p>

				<h4>Primary Alcohols</h4>
				
				<p>Primary alcohols are hydrocarbons with an OH attached to either side of the parent chain. The carbon attached to the OH will always have two hydrogens attached to it as well.<br><br>
				
				When reacted with an oxidising agent like Potassium Dichromate, a primary alcohol can undergo two redox reactions. After oxidising once, the alcohol will become an aldehyde which end in “-al”. Instead of a hydroxyl group attached to the end of a carbon chain, the carbon will be double bonded to an oxygen and single bonded to a hydrogen. The aldehyde can oxidise further into a carboxylic acid. This compound ends in “-oic acid” and the carbon at the end of the chain will be double bonded to an oxygen, and single bonded to a OH.</p>
				<img src="../img/primary-alcohol-oxidation-reaction.png" alt="" width="50%">
				
				<h4>Secondary Alcohols</h4>
				
				<p>The OH of a secondary alcohol is attached to a carbon within the chain. The carbon that has a hydroxyl group attached will also have one hydrogen attached.<br><br>
				
				Can also be oxidised with potassium dichromate. When the carbon with an OH is attacked, it will lose its hydrogen atom, and the electron that was attached to it will return to the carbon, creating a double bond with the OH. However, because there is a double bond, the OH will lose its O. The end product of the oxidation reaction is a ketone which end in “-one”.</p>
				<img src="../img/secondary-alcohol-oxidation-reaction.gif" alt="" width="60%">
				
				<h4>Tertiary Alcohols</h4>
				
				<p>Tertiary alcohols also have an OH group attached with the carbon chain. However, the carbon attached to it will have no other hydrogens attached<br><br>
				
				Because there are no hydrogens, tertiary alcohols cannot undergo oxidation.</p>
				<img src="../img/tertiary-alcohol.png" alt="" width="25%">
				
				<p>In the event that there are unknown hydrocarbons with different functional groups that need to be identified, there are several tests that can be done to distinguish them. When testing for alcoholic groups, one just needs to add potassium dichromate to the solution. If the solution is an alcohol, the dichromate will oxidise, and the colour will change from orange to green. This method only proves a solution is an alcohol however and does not distinguish between primary and secondary. <br><br>
				
				To prove whether it is primary or secondary, one just needs to find evidence that the alcohol oxidised into a carboxylic acid or not. This can be done with the sodium hydrogen carbonate test. Carboxylic acids (such as propanoic acid) will react with carbonate bases such as sodium hydrogen carbonate. The reaction can be seen as the release of carbon dioxide and water. The CO2 is released as bubbles of gas. If this reaction is seen when reacted with the carbonate base, it is a carboxylic acid. If there is no reaction, it is most likely a ketone.</p>
				
				<h3>Aim</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of this investigation practical is to predict or identify the unknown chemical substances by observing the redox reactions that occur when the known oxidising agent is added.</p>
				
				<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
				
				<p>If the potassium dichromate does not dissolve or oxidise with the unknown organic compound solution, then it is the non-alcohol (hexane) as non-alcohols do not have a hydroxyl (OH) attached and therefore cannot form hydrogen bonds with the oxidising agent. <br><br>
				
				If the potassium dichromate dissolves with the unknown organic compound but does not oxidise, it is either a ketone (propanone) because ketones don’t have a hydroxyl group to oxidise, or a tertiary alcohol (2-methylpropane-2-ol), because tertiary alcohols don’t have any Hydrogens attached to the C-OH group to oxidise.<br><br>
				
				If the potassium dichromate dissolves and oxidises with the unknown organic compound (indicated by a colour change from orange to green) then it is an alcohol (propanol) or aldehyde (propanal).</p>

				<h3>Discussion and Analysis</h3>
				
				<p>When sample A was reacted with potassium dichromate, there was a positive reaction. When it was mixed/shook around, the solution turned a bluish green colour periodically, but as the solution stopped spinning, the blue-green liquid floated to the bottom of the tube. The rest of the solution was clear, however the colour change indicated that oxidation occurred, and it was either a primary or secondary alcohol. When reacted with the sodium hydrogen carbonate, the reaction was also positive, and produced small bubbles. This indicates that a primary alcohol or an aldehyde was oxidised into a carboxylic acid. It was concluded to be the aldehyde (propanal) because the two reactions were much smaller in comparison to sample D which was the other positive test for an alcohol and carboxylic acid. It didn’t turn fully green or produce many bubbles, while sample D did. Because the result of the reaction was smaller, it can be deduced that only one oxidation reaction occurred. If only one oxidation reaction occurred, it is the aldehyde.<br><br>
				
				Both sample B and C had extremely similar reactions. They both dissolved with the oxidising agent and turned orange, however, it did not oxidise and turn green. This indicates that they were either a ketone, or a tertiary alcohol. The only difference between the two is that sample B looked more dense than C. It was concluded that sample B was the tertiary alcohol because 2-methylpropan-2-ol has more mass, making it slightly more dense. Sample C was concluded to be the ketone because it is less dense.<br><br>
				
				Sample D had two positive reactions. It oxidised with the dichromate, turning fully green, and rapidly formed large bubbles when reacted with the sodium hydrogen carbonate. The more full oxidation reaction with the dichromate indicated that it oxidised twice before becoming a carboxylic acid. Therefore, sample D was a primary alcohol – propanol.<br><br>
				
				When the potassium dichromate was added to sample E, it did not dissolve or oxidise. This indicates that it was the alkane (hexane), because alkyls are insoluble.</p>

				<p>There were several limitations for this practical. The main one was the method. Only two tests were used to find the unknown hydrocarbons and functional groups. Although somewhat good conclusions were made, these deductions could have been more accurate if other tests were added to the method. A solubility test could have been added to differentiate between tertiary alcohols and ketones more easily. A tollens reagent test also could have been added to be more certain of which is the aldehyde. Time was also a limitation, as there were lots of tests to do and observe in under an hour. Cleaning and preparation would also be included in this time, making the experiment more rushed and less accurate.</p>
				
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p>By using the potassium dichromate and sodium hydrogen carbonate to test for alcohols and carboxylic acids, as well as other common chemistry knowledge and the process of elimination, sample A was found to be propanal, sample B was 2-methylpropan-2-ol, sample C was propanone, sample D was propanol and sample E was hexane.</p>
