				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>When dealing with electricity and circuits, Ohm’s law is a very important concept to know and understand. The law was discovered and named after scientist George Ohm. It is a simple formula that describes the relationship between Voltage (V) measured in volts, Current (I) measured in Amps and Resistance (R) measured in Ohms:</p>
				<img src="../img/ohms-law.PNG" alt="Ohm's Law: V = IR" width="50%">
				<p>This equation shows that the current is directly proportional to the voltage: I∝V. This means if the voltage is increased, the current will also increase. It also states that the current is inversely proportional to the resistance: I∝1/R. This means that if the resistance increases, the current will decrease, but if the resistance decreases, the current will increase. Finally, Ohm’s law states that the resistance of a conductor is constant. No matter how much the voltage or current is changed in a circuit, the resistance should always stay the same. In theory, all conductors of electricity should follow this law. However, not all do, and so conductors are usually split into two categories, ohmic and non-ohmic. Ohmic conductors follow Ohm’s law. When the relationship between the current and voltage of an ohmic conductor is showed on a scatter plot graph, the relationship is linear, or in a straight line. Non-Ohmic conductors however do neither of these, and the resistance does not stay constant when the current or voltage is changed.<br><br>
				This means that any conductor can be tested to find out if it is ohmic or non-ohmic. One just needs to graph the relationship between the current and voltage of the conductor. A rheostat or variable resistor can be used to more accurately control how much voltage is going through into the conductor, and both the Amps and Volts can be measured with a multi-meter.</p>
				
				<h3>Aim</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of the practical is to determine whether the conductors used (12V lightbulb and Nichrome Wire) are ohmic or non-ohmic conductors by measuring and recording the mathematical relationship between Current and Voltage on a graph.</p>
				
				<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
				
				<p>As the voltage is increased, the current too, will increase. When the mathematical relationship between the current and voltage is shown on a scatter plot graph, if the relationship is linear, then the conductor is ohmic. However, if it is not linear, and shows a curve, then the conductor is non-ohmic.</p>

				<h3>Procedure</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Set up circuit shown in Figure 1.0 using one variable power pack</li>
					<li>Create a table that is 2x30 for results – the two headings should be Current (A) and EMF (V). Refer to table 1.1 for reference</li>
					<li>Turn on the power pack and set it to 2V</li>
					<li>Slide the rheostat until reading of voltmeter is as close to 1V as possible</li>
					<li>Record results on Voltmeter and Ammeter onto table</li>
					<li>Slide rheostat until reading on voltmeter is as close to 2V as possible – If not possible, turn power pack to 4V and adjust rheostat accordingly, then record results to table</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 3 – 6, increasing the voltage and sliding the rheostat until reading on voltmeter reaches as close to the next integer as possible and recording results. When doing 13 – 24V piggybacking another power pack will be necessary</li>
					<li>Once bulb busts, the next experiment can begin – repeat steps 1 – 7, however instead of using a 12V lightbulb, use a Nichrome wire, and instead of repeating steps until lightbulb busts, repeat until Nichrome wire glows extremely bright orange and begins to smell like it’s burning</li>
					<li>Once all results are recorded in table, use excel to put results into a scatter plot graph. Don’t forget to add line of best fit, R2 (coefficient of determination) and equation of line. Also use excel to set the y intercept to 0, because if it is not then there is an error</li>
					<li>Determine whether the conductor is ohmic or non-ohmic. It is ohmic when the relationship between the current and volts is linear. It’s non-ohmic when it’s not linear.</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Discussion and Analysis</h3>
				
				<p>Each of the results and graphs were able to demonstrate and prove the first part of the hypothesis – as the voltage was increased, the current too, increased. This proves that both the 12V battery and the nichrome wire followed part of Ohm’s law – I∝V. However, this does not prove that both are ohmic conductors. In Graph 1.1, the line of best fit had a fairly large gradient of approximately 14.83. The coefficient of determination was 0.9774, which implies that the results are very close to the line of best fit and were accurate. However, the graph also had a large y-intercept of -6.78. Theoretically, this graph should have no y-intercept, as if there is no voltage, then there cannot be any current. Having a y-intercept means that there is a systematic error. The y-intercept was set to 0 in graph 1.2, to more accurately show a line of best fit. This time, the dots of the scatter plot are much further away from the line of best fit, and the coefficient of determination is slightly smaller, indicating less accuracy. The plots on the graph also clearly do not show a linear relationship. Therefore, it can be concluded that 12V lightbulb is a non-ohmic conductor. This makes sense as when current flows through the metal filament in the bulb, its temperature increases dramatically. This excessive heat causes the resistance to increase along with the current which is not an ohmic quality.<br><br>
				
				The results shown in graph 2.1 and 2.2 were much more accurate. The y-intercept was miniscule and both coefficients of determination were 0.999. Furthermore, the mathematical relationship between the voltage and current is clearly linear. All this evidence suggests and proves that the nichrome wire is an ohmic conductor.</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p>Both the 12V lightbulb and the nichrome wire showed part of Ohm’s law, which is that I∝V, because as the voltage increased, the current also increased. However, the mathematical relationship between current and voltage of the lightbulb was not linear, therefore the lightbulb is a non-ohmic conductor. The nichrome wire however, did show a linear relationship, and followed Ohm’s law exactly, and therefore is proven to be an ohmic conductor. Because of this, the purpose of the practical was completed and hypothesis was proven, making the experiment a success.</p>
