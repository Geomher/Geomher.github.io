				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				
				<p>A simple pendulum is a mass that is suspended off the ground with a string attached to a fixed pivot point that will allow it to swing from side to side. There are several forces acting upon it including gravity, tension (of string). In the vector diagram below (figure 1), FTENS is the string tension force, Fgrav is the force of gravity. Figure 2 shows the potential and kinetic energy transfers. As the mass of the pendulum is pulled downward towards the centre by gravity, kinetic energy increases, while potential energy decreases. As the pendulum swings up, kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases.</p>

				<p>In 1583, the well know Italian scientist Galileo observed a chandelier while in church and timed its period, or time for one oscillation with his heartbeat. After some research, he concluded that the period of all simple pendulums is always constant, and created a formula that is capable of finding the period of any simple pendulum:</p>
				<img src="../img/pendulum-formula.PNG" alt="Pendulum Formula" width="8.5%">
				<p>In this equation, T is the period, L is the length of the string from the top to the centre of mass, and g is the acceleration of gravity at the Earth’s surface. However it is hard to comment on the mathematical relationships that exist in this formula because of the square root, however that can be removed by squaring both sides of the equation:</p>
				<img src="../img/pendulum-formula-squared.PNG" alt="Pendulum Formula Squared" width=" 8.5%">
				<p>This formula can be tested and proven with an experiment, in which a simple pendulum is made, and the period is timed using a stopwatch. In the experiment, the value of L is changed each time, and would be seen that T2 is directly proportional to Length (T^2∝L), as when the length of the pendulum increases, the period would increase too. T2 is inversely proportional to gravity (T^2∝1/g), as when g is increased, T2 will decrease. Furthermore, the value of 2π and g in the formula is constant. According to the Australian Fundamental Gravity Network, which has several sites located around Australia, the acceleration of gravity in Darwin is approximately 9.78 ms-2. <br><br>
				The acceleration of gravity can also be proved to be this value using the simple pendulum experiment. After the period is found, the formula can be solved to find the equation for gravity:</p>
				<img src="../img/derived-gravity-formula.PNG" alt="Gravity equation derived from pendulum period equation">
				
				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				
				<p>The purpose of the experiment is to prove that Galileo’s formula is accurate. It is also to prove that the acceleration of gravity (in Darwin) is approximately 9.78 ms-2.</p>
				
				<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
				
				<p>As the length of the string is increased, the period of the string will also increase. Galileo’s formula will also prove that gravity is approximately 9.78 ms-2.</p>

				<h3>Apparatus</h3>
					
				<img src="../img/pendulum-prac-apparatus.PNG" alt="apparatus" width="60%">
				
				<h3>Method</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Gather materials</li>
					<li>Draw a 7x9 results table – along the left side boxes of the table the headings should be the 9 different lengths of string, along the top boxes of the table the headings should be Trial 1, Trial 2, Trial 3, Average Trial, Average period (T), T2 – See table 1.0 for reference</li>
					<li>Tie end of string to 10g plasticine ball</li>
					<li>Tape other end of string to roof</li>
					<li>Adjust string so that Length from top to centre of mass is 265cm</li>
					<li>Pull the pendulum back at a small angle (angle does not affect results but smaller angle creates a pendulum movement that is easier to count the periods accurately)</li>
					<li>Let go of pendulum and begin timer</li>
					<li>Wait until 20 periods have been completed and stop timer</li>
					<li>Record results in trial 1</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 6 - 9 until there are 3 trials worth of results</li>
					<li>Calculate average time of 3 trials and record onto table</li>
					<li>Divide average time by 20 to find the period and record result onto table</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 10 – 12 but adjust length of string so it is at least 20cm shorter each time</li>
					<li>Repeat Steps 1 – 13, however use a shoe instead of a plasticine ball, and only use 3 pendulum lengths – 43.5cm, 73.5cm and 220cm.</li>
					<li>Create a scatter plot graph with Excel using results obtained from experiment. Don’t forget to add line of best fit, R2 (Coefficient of determination) and equation of line (to find equation, rearrange Galileo’s formula so it matches linear equation: y = mx. The equation should become T^2=(4π^2)/g*L)</li>
					<li>Excel will give you the gradient (m) which will be m=(4π^2)/g. This can be rearranged to find gravity: g=(4π^2)/m. Use this equation to find gravity for the plasticine pendulum and shoe pendulum.</li>
					<li>Calculate the average gravity by adding both gravity figures together and dividing the result by two.</li>

				<h3>Discussion and Analysis</h3>
				
				Each of the graphs were able to demonstrate and prove the first part of the hypothesis: as the length of the string was increased, the length of the period also increased. This shows that T<sup>2</sup>∝L. All of the graphs also had a very high coefficient of determination, indicating that the results obtained were very close to the line of best fit and increased at the same rate. However, each graph also had a very small y-intercept. This shows that a systematic error took place as it should not be possible for a y-intercept to occur. This is because when there is no string, there cannot be a swing. This error is probably due to the small amount of results, as Excel only estimates the line of best fit with the results given.<br><br>
				
				In graph 1.2 (Plasticine Pendulum), the gradient of the trendline is 3.8169. When this is substituted into the formula g=(4π^2)/m, the acceleration of gravity is approximately 10.34ms<sup>-2</sup>. According to the Australian Fundamental Gravity Network, the acceleration of Darwin is approximately 9.78ms<sup>-2</sup>. This means that the results obtained in this practical is 0.56 off and had several errors. The acceleration of gravity obtained from the results in graph 2.2 (Shoe Pendulum) was found to be 9.14ms<sup>-2</sup>.  This too, is over 0.5 off. Both of these had large errors because of a major limitation that was present during the practical. This of course is the limitation of humans. Several times when measuring the string, the students did not measure with complete accuracy and instead rounded or estimated lengths. Despite these errors however, when the two gravities of the two pendulums were added together and divided by two to find the average, gravity was found to be 9.74ms<sup>-2</sup>. While this result is close to the actual gravity of Darwin, it should not be considered accurate as there were too many errors involved in the results used to calculate this.<br><br>
				
				While it cannot be said that the group who recorded these results were completely successful in proving gravity, it can be confirmed that they weren’t the only group. When compared to the full class results, the gravities were fairly similar. The results from graph 1.4 had a gravity of 10.27ms-2, and the gravity of the results from graph 2.3 was 10.05ms-2. This demonstrates that other groups in the class also had several errors and weren’t able to prove gravity was 9.78ms-2. However, all of the gravity results obtained weren’t too far off (0.6 or less) so it can be agreed that gravity, and Galileo’s formula was proved to some extent.

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>
				
				<p>The acceleration of gravity was found to be 10.34ms<sup>-2</sup> obtained from the plasticine pendulum results and 9.18ms<sup>-2</sup> obtained from the shoe pendulum results. Both of these are over 0.5 off from the acceleration of gravity in Darwin according to the Australian Fundamental Gravity Network (which was 9.78ms<sup>-2</sup>) due to several random and systematic errors made. Despite this, when the average of these two results were calculated, gravity was found to be 9.74ms<sup>-2</sup>. While there were many errors made during the practical which produced results that weren’t entirely accurate, it can still be concluded that the purpose of the experiment to prove gravity was 9.78ms<sup>-2</sup> was met to some extent.</p>
